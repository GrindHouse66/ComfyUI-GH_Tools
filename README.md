GH Tools for ComfyUI

Simple quality of life Tools for ComfyUI

Basically, If it makes my life easier, it will be here. The list will grow over time.

GH Tools Image Sizer is a simple tool that takes a base image width, and the desired aspect ratio, and outputs the correct height.

GH Tools Simple Scale takes the Width and Height from another node (eg GH Tools Image Sizer), and applies a user specified scale factor to it, outputting the scaled Width and Height. Useful for upscale methods that require manual scale calculations.

GH Tools Image Viewer is a multi-purpose version of the original SaveImage and PreviewImage nodes from ComfyUI. Through a simple Mode drop down, you can choose the action of the node. The Modes are Bypass (do nothing), Preview (preview the image without saving), and Save (preview the image and save it).

To install in ComfyUI, clone the repository inside the Custom Nodes folders.
