Simple quality of life Tools for ComfyUI

Basically, If it makes my life easier, it will be here. The list will grow over time.

GH Tools Image Sizer is a simple tool that takes a base image width, and the desired aspect ratio, and outputs the correct height.
GH Tools Simple Scale takes the Width and Height from another node (eg GH Tools Image Sizer), and apples a user specified scale factor to it, outputting the scalled Width and Height. Useful for upscale methods that require manual scale calculations.


To install in ComfyUI, clone the repository inside the Custom Nodes folders.
